# Quiz Webpage
The purpose of this repo is to monitor my progress in learning HTML and CSS by Building a Quiz. I am utilizing the freeCodeCamp's [Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-typography-by-building-a-nutrition-label) for this repo. 

In this course, I'll build a quiz webpage. I'll also learn accessibility tools such as keyboard shortcuts, ARIA attributes, and design best practices.
